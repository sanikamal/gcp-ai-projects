Data mining is a related field of study, focusing on exploratory data analysis (EDA) via unsupervised learning. \\nFrom a theoretical viewpoint, probably approximately correct (PAC) learning provides a framework for describing machine learning.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\nThe term machine learning was coined in 1959 by Arthur Samuel, an IBM employee and pioneer in the field of computer gaming and artificial intelligence. The synonym self-teaching computers was also used in this time period.\\nAlthough the earliest machine learning model was introduced in the 1950s when Arthur Samuel invented a program that calculated the winning chance in checkers for each side, the history of machine learning roots back to decades of human desire and effort to study human cognitive processes. In 1949, Canadian psychologist Donald Hebb published the book The Organization of Behavior, in which he introduced a theoretical neural structure formed by certain interactions among nerve cells. Hebb\\'s model of neurons interacting with one another set a groundwork for how AIs and machine learning algorithms work under nodes, or artificial neurons used by computers to communicate data. Other researchers who have studied human cognitive systems contributed to the modern machine learning technologies as well, including logician Walter Pitts and Warren McCulloch, who proposed the early mathematical models of neural networks to come up with algorithms that mirror human thought processes.\\nBy the early 1960s, an experimental \"learning machine\" with punched tape memory, called Cybertron, had been developed by Raytheon Company to analyze sonar signals, electrocardiograms, and speech patterns using rudimentary reinforcement learning. It was repetitively \"trained\" by a human operator/teacher to recognize patterns and equipped with a \"goof\" button to cause it to reevaluate incorrect decisions. A representative book on research into machine learning during the 1960s was Nilsson\\'s book on Learning Machines, dealing mostly with machine learning for pattern classification. Interest related to pattern recognition continued into the 1970s, as described by Duda and Hart in 1973. In 1981 a report was given on using teaching strategies so that an artificial neural network learns to recognize 40 characters (26 letters, 10 digits, and 4 special symbols) from a computer terminal.\\nTom M. Mitchell provided a widely quoted, more formal definition of the algorithms studied in the machine learning field: \"A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P,  improves with experience E.\" This definition of the tasks in which machine learning is concerned offers a fundamentally operational definition rather than defining the field in cognitive terms. This follows Alan Turing\\'s proposal in his paper \"Computing Machinery and Intelligence\", in which the question \"Can machines think?\" is replaced with the question \"Can machines do what we (as thinking entities) can do?\".\\nModern-day machine learning has two objectives.  One is to classify data based on models which have been developed; the other purpose is to make predictions for future outcomes based on thes')"

The synonym self-teaching computers was also used in this time period.\\nAlthough the earliest machine learning model was introduced in the 1950s when Arthur Samuel invented a program that calculated the winning chance in checkers for each side, the history of machine learning roots back to decades of human desire and effort to study human cognitive processes. In 1949, Canadian psychologist Donald Hebb published the book The Organization of Behavior, in which he introduced a theoretical neural structure formed by certain interactions among nerve cells. Hebb\\'s model of neurons interacting with one another set a groundwork for how AIs and machine learning algorithms work under nodes, or artificial neurons used by computers to communicate data. Other researchers who have studied human cognitive systems contributed to the modern machine learning technologies as well, including logician Walter Pitts and Warren McCulloch, who proposed the early mathematical models of neural networks to come up with algorithms that mirror human thought processes.\\nBy the early 1960s, an experimental \"learning machine\" with punched tape memory, called Cybertron, had been developed by Raytheon Company to analyze sonar signals, electrocardiograms, and speech patterns using rudimentary reinforcement learning. It was repetitively \"trained\" by a human operator/teacher to recognize patterns and equipped with a \"goof\" button to cause it to reevaluate incorrect decisions. A representative book on research into machine learning during the 1960s was Nilsson\\'s book on Learning Machines, dealing mostly with machine learning for pattern classification. Interest related to pattern recognition continued into the 1970s, as described by Duda and Hart in 1973. In 1981 a report was given on using teaching strategies so that an artificial neural network learns to recognize 40 characters (26 letters, 10 digits, and 4 special symbols) from a computer terminal.\\nTom M. Mitchell provided a widely quoted, more formal definition of the algorithms studied in the machine learning field: \"A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P,  improves with experience E.\" This definition of the tasks in which machine learning is concerned offers a fundamentally operational definition rather than defining the field in cognitive terms. This follows Alan Turing\\'s proposal in his paper \"Computing Machinery and Intelligence\", in which the question \"Can machines think?\" is replaced with the question \"Can machines do what we (as thinking entities) can do?\".\\nModern-day machine learning has two objectives.  One is to classify data based on models which have been developed; the other purpose is to make predictions for future outcomes based on thes'),\n",

(Around 2007, some spammers added random noise to fuzz words within \"image spam\" in order to defeat OCR-based filters.) In 2006, Marco Barreno and others published \"Can Machine Learning Be Secure?\", outlining a broad taxonomy of attacks. As late as 2013 many researchers continued to hope that non-linear classifiers (such as support vector machines and neural networks) might be robust to adversaries, until Battista Biggio and others demonstrated the first gradient-based attacks on such machine-learning models (2012–2013). In 2012, deep neural networks began to dominate computer vision problems; starting in 2014, Christian Szegedy and others demonstrated that deep neural networks could be fooled by adversaries, again using a gradient-based attack to craft adversarial perturbations.\\nRecently, it was observed that adversarial attacks are harder to produce in the practical world due to the different environmental constraints that cancel out the effect of noise. For example, any small rotation or slight illumination on an adversarial image can destroy the adversariality. In addition, researchers such as Google Brain\\'s Nicholas Frosst point out that it is much easier to make self-driving cars miss stop signs by physically removing the sign itself, rather than creating adversarial examples. Frosst also believes that the adversarial machine learning community incorrectly assumes models trained on a certain data distribution will also perform well on a completely different data distribution. He suggests that a new approach to machine learning should be explored, and is currently working on a unique neural network that has characteristics more similar to human perception than state-of-the-art approaches.\\nWhile adversarial machine learning continues to be heavily rooted in academia, large tech companies such as Google, Microsoft, and IBM have begun curating documentation and open source code bases to allow others to concretely assess the robustness of machine learning models and minimize the risk of adversarial attacks.\\n\\n\\n=== Examples ===\\nExamples include attacks in spam filtering, where spam messages are obfuscated through the misspelling of \"bad\" words or the insertion of \"good\" words; attacks in computer security, such as obfuscating malware code within network packets or modifying the characteristics of a network flow to mislead intrusion detection; attacks in biometric recognition where fake biometric traits may be exploited to impersonate a legitimate user; or to compromise users\\' template galleries that adapt to updated traits over time.\\nResearchers showed that by changing only one-pixel it was possible to fool deep learning algorithms.

They can learn from experience, and can derive conclusions from a complex and seemingly unrelated set of information.\\n\\n\\n== Training ==\\nNeural networks are typically trained through empirical risk minimization. This method is based on the idea of optimizing the network\\'s parameters to minimize the difference, or empirical risk, between the predicted output and the actual target values in a given dataset. Gradient-based methods such as backpropagation are usually used to estimate the parameters of the network. During the training phase, ANNs learn from labeled training data by iteratively updating their parameters to minimize a defined loss function. This method allows the network to generalize to unseen data.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\n\\n=== Early work ===\\nToday\\'s deep neural networks are based on early work in statistics over 200 years ago. The simplest kind of feedforward neural network (FNN) is a linear network, which consists of a single layer of output nodes with linear activation functions; the inputs are fed directly to the outputs via a series of weights. The sum of the products of the weights and the inputs is calculated at each node. The mean squared errors between these calculated outputs and the given target values are minimized by creating an adjustment to the weights. This technique has been known for over two centuries as the method of least squares or linear regression. It was used as a means of finding a good rough linear fit to a set of points by Legendre (1805) and Gauss (1795) for the prediction of planetary movement.\\nHistorically, digital computers such as the von Neumann model operate via the execution of explicit instructions with access to memory by a number of processors. Some neural networks, on the other hand, originated from efforts to model information processing in biological systems through the framework of connectionism. Unlike the von Neumann model, connectionist computing does not separate memory and processing.\\nWarren McCulloch and Walter Pitts (1943) considered a non-learning computational model for neural networks. This model paved the way for research to split into two approaches. One approach focused on biological processes while the other focused on the application of neural networks to artificial intelligence.\\nIn the late 1940s, D. O. Hebb proposed a learning hypothesis based on the mechanism of neural plasticity that became known as Hebbian learning. It was used in many early neural networks, such as Rosenblatt\\'s perceptron and the Hopfield network. Farley and Clark (1954) used computational machines to simulate a Hebbian network.

In the literature, permutation equivariant layers are implemented via pairwise message passing between graph nodes. Intuitively, in a message passing layer, nodes update their representations by aggregating the messages received from their immediate neighbours. As such, each message passing layer increases the receptive field of the GNN by one hop.\\nLocal pooling: a local pooling layer coarsens the graph via downsampling. Local pooling is used to increase the receptive field of a GNN, in a similar fashion to pooling layers in convolutional neural networks. Examples include k-nearest neighbours pooling, top-k pooling, and self-attention pooling.\\nGlobal pooling: a global pooling layer, also known as readout layer, provides fixed-size representation of the whole graph. The global pooling layer must be permutation invariant, such that permutations in the ordering of graph nodes and edges do not alter the final output. Examples include element-wise sum, mean or maximum.\\nIt has been demonstrated that GNNs cannot be more expressive than the Weisfeiler–Leman Graph Isomorphism Test. In practice, this means that there exist different graph structures (e.g., molecules with the same atoms but different bonds) that cannot be distinguished by GNNs. More powerful GNNs operating on higher-dimension geometries such as simplicial complexes can be designed.

It is based on the Structured State Space sequence (S4) model.\\n\\n\\n== Architecture ==\\nTo enable handling long data sequences, Mamba incorporates the Structured State Space sequence model (S4). S4 can effectively and efficiently model long dependencies by combining continuous-time, recurrent, and convolutional models. These enable it to handle irregularly sampled data, unbounded context, and remain computationally efficient during training and inferencing.\\nMamba introduces significant enhancements to S4, particularly in its treatment of time-variant operations. It adopts a unique selection mechanism that adapts structured state space model (SSM) parameters based on the input. This enables Mamba to selectively focus on relevant information within sequences, effectively filtering out less pertinent data. The model transitions from a time-invariant to a time-varying framework, which impacts both computation and efficiency.\\nMamba employs a hardware-aware algorithm that exploits GPUs, by using kernel fusion, parallel scan, and recomputation. The implementation avoids materializing expanded states in memory-intensive layers, thereby improving performance and memory usage. The result is significantly more efficient in processing long sequences compared to transformers.\\nAdditionally, Mamba simplifies its architecture by integrating the SSM design with MLP blocks, resulting in a homogeneous and streamlined structure, furthering the model\\'s capability for general sequence modeling across data types that include language, audio, and genomics, while maintaining efficiency in both training and inference.\\n\\n\\n=== Key components ===\\nSelective-State-Spaces (SSM): The core of Mamba, SSMs are recurrent models that selectively process information based on the current input. This allows them to focus on relevant information and discard irrelevant data.\\nSimplified Architecture: Mamba replaces the complex attention and MLP blocks of Transformers with a single, unified SSM block. This aims to reduce computational complexity and improve inference speed.\\nHardware-Aware Parallelism: Mamba utilizes a recurrent mode with a parallel algorithm specifically designed for hardware efficiency, potentially further enhancing its performance.\\n\\n\\n== Variants ==\\n\\n\\n=== Token-free language models: MambaByte ===\\n\\nOperating on byte-sized tokens, transformers scale poorly as every token must \"attend\" to every other token leading to O(n2) scaling laws, as a result, Transformers opt to use subword tokenization to reduce the number of tokens in text, however, this leads to very large vocabulary tables and word embeddings.\\nThis research investigates a novel approach to language modeling, MambaByte, which departs from the standard token-based methods. Unlike traditional models that rely on breaking text into discrete units, MambaByte directly processes raw byte sequences.  This eliminates the need for tokenization, potentially offering several advantages:\\n\\nLanguage Independence: Tokenization often relies on language-specific rules and vocabulary, limiting applicability across diverse languages. MambaByte\\'s byte-level representation allows it to handle different languages without language-specific adaptations.\\nRemoves the bias of subword tokenisation: where common subwords are overrepresented and rare or new words are underrepresented or split into less meaningful units. This can affect the model\\'s understanding and generation capabilities, particularly for languages with rich morphology or tokens not well-represented in the training data.\\nSimplicity in Preprocessing: It simplifies the preprocessing pipeline by eliminating the need for complex tokenization and vocabulary management, reducing the preprocessing steps and potential errors.\\n'),\n",

A well-cited early example was the Elman network (1990). In theory, the information from one token can propagate arbitrarily far down the sequence, but in practice the vanishing-gradient problem leaves the model\\'s state at the end of a long sentence without precise, extractable information about preceding tokens.\\nA key breakthrough was LSTM (1995), a RNN which used various innovations to overcome the vanishing gradient problem, allowing efficient learning of long-sequence modelling. One key innovation was the use of an attention mechanism which used neurons that multiply the outputs of other neurons, so-called multiplicative units. Neural networks using multiplicative units were later called sigma-pi networks or higher-order networks. LSTM became the standard architecture for long sequence modelling until the 2017 publication of Transformers.\\nHowever, LSTM still used sequential processing, like most other RNNs. Specifically, RNNs operate one token at a time from first to last; they cannot operate in parallel over all tokens in a sequence. \\nModern Transformers overcome this problem, but unlike RNNs, they require computation time that is quadratic in the size of the context window.  The linearly scaling fast weight controller (1992) learns  to compute a  weight matrix for further processing depending on the input. One of its two networks has  \"fast weights\" or \"dynamic links\" (1981). A slow neural network learns by gradient descent to generate keys and values for computing the weight changes of the fast neural network which computes answers to queries. This was later shown to be equivalent to the unnormalized linear Transformer.\\n\\n\\n=== Attention with seq2seq ===\\n\\nThe idea of encoder-decoder sequence transduction had been developed in the early 2010s (see  for previous papers). The papers most commonly cited as the originators that produced seq2seq are two concurrently published papers from 2014.\\n(Sutskever et al, 2014)  was a 380M-parameter model for machine translation using two long short-term memory (LSTM). The architecture consists of two parts. The encoder is an LSTM that takes in a sequence of tokens and turns it into a vector. The decoder is another LSTM that converts the vector into a sequence of tokens. Similarly, (Cho et al, 2014) was 130M-parameter model that used gated recurrent units (GRU) instead of LSTM.

Freund and Schapire\\'s arcing (Adapt[at]ive Resampling and Combining), as a general technique, is more or less synonymous with boosting.\\n\\n\\n== Algorithms ==\\nWhile boosting is not algorithmically constrained, most boosting algorithms consist of iteratively learning weak classifiers with respect to a distribution and adding them to a final strong classifier. When they are added, they are weighted in a way that is related to the weak learners\\' accuracy.  After a weak learner is added, the data weights are readjusted, known as \"re-weighting\". Misclassified input data gain a higher weight and examples that are classified correctly lose weight. Thus, future weak learners focus more on the examples that previous weak learners misclassified.\\n\\nThere are many boosting algorithms. The original ones, proposed by Robert Schapire (a recursive majority gate formulation), and Yoav Freund (boost by majority), were not adaptive and could not take full advantage of the weak learners. Schapire and Freund then developed AdaBoost, an adaptive boosting algorithm that won the prestigious Gödel Prize.\\nOnly algorithms that are provable boosting algorithms in the probably approximately correct learning formulation can accurately be called boosting algorithms.  Other algorithms that are similar in spirit to boosting algorithms are sometimes called \"leveraging algorithms\", although they are also sometimes incorrectly called boosting algorithms.\\nThe main variation between many boosting algorithms is their method of weighting training data points and hypotheses. AdaBoost is very popular and the most significant historically as it was the first algorithm that could adapt to the weak learners. It is often the basis of introductory coverage of boosting in university machine learning courses. There are many more recent algorithms such as LPBoost, TotalBoost, BrownBoost, xgboost, MadaBoost, LogitBoost, and others. Many boosting algorithms fit into the AnyBoost framework, which shows that boosting performs gradient descent in a function space using a convex cost function.\\n\\n\\n== Object categorization in computer vision ==\\n\\nGiven images containing various known objects in the world, a classifier can be learned from them to automatically classify the objects in future images.  Simple classifiers built based on some image feature of the object tend to be weak in categorization performance. Using boosting methods for object categorization is a way to unify the weak classifiers in a special way to boost the overall ability of categorization.\\n\\n\\n=== Problem of object categorization ===\\nObject categorization is a typical task of computer vision that involves determining whether or not an image contains some specific category of object.  The idea is closely related with recognition, identification, and detection.  Appearance based object categorization typically contains feature extraction, learning a classifier, and applying the classifier to new examples.  There a'),\n",

In the literature, permutation equivariant layers are implemented via pairwise message passing between graph nodes. Intuitively, in a message passing layer, nodes update their representations by aggregating the messages received from their immediate neighbours. As such, each message passing layer increases the receptive field of the GNN by one hop.\\nLocal pooling: a local pooling layer coarsens the graph via downsampling. Local pooling is used to increase the receptive field of a GNN, in a similar fashion to pooling layers in convolutional neural networks. Examples include k-nearest neighbours pooling, top-k pooling, and self-attention pooling.\\nGlobal pooling: a global pooling layer, also known as readout layer, provides fixed-size representation of the whole graph. The global pooling layer must be permutation invariant, such that permutations in the ordering of graph nodes and edges do not alter the final output. Examples include element-wise sum, mean or maximum.\\nIt has been demonstrated that GNNs cannot be more expressive than the Weisfeiler–Leman Graph Isomorphism Test. In practice, this means that there exist different graph structures (e.g., molecules with the same atoms but different bonds) that cannot be distinguished by GNNs. More powerful GNNs operating on higher-dimension geometries such as simplicial complexes can be designed. As of 2022, whether or not future architectures will overcome the message passing primitive is an open research question.\\n\\n\\n== Message passing layers ==\\n\\nMessage passing layers are permutation-equivariant layers mapping a graph into an updated representation of the same graph. Formally, they can be expressed as message passing neural networks (MPNNs).\\nLet \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        G\\n        =\\n        (\\n        V\\n        ,\\n        E\\n        )\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle G=(V,E)}\\n  \\n be a graph, where \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        V\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle V}\\n  \\n is the node set and \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        E\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle E}\\n  \\n is the edge set.
